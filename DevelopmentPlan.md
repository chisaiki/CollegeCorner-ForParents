# CollegeCorner-ForParents Development Plan

## Project Overview
A React application designed to help parents navigate the college process for their children.

## Implementation Order

### Phase 1: Foundation (Get it working)
1. **Install react-router-dom**
   - Command: `npm install react-router-dom`
   
2. **Set up basic routing in App.jsx**
   - Configure routes for Home and Resources pages
   - Import and set up BrowserRouter, Routes, Route
   
3. **Create skeleton components**
   - Home.jsx with basic "Hello World" content
   - Resources.jsx with basic "Hello World" content
   
4. **Add basic navigation**
   - Simple buttons/links to test routing functionality
   
5. **Test navigation**
   - Verify clicking between pages works correctly

### Phase 2: Structure & Layout
6. **Design basic layout**
   - Header, navigation bar, footer in App.jsx
   - Define overall page structure
   - Card-based content for different sections
   - Clean sidebar navigation for easy access
   - Dashboard-style homepage with key info at a glance
   
   #### Topography
   - Large, readable fonts (parents often 40+ years old)
   - Clear headings to organize information
   - Good contrast for accessibility
   
7. **Add proper navigation menu**
   - Styled navigation with proper links
   - Use Link components from react-router-dom
   
8. **Set up basic styling**
   - CSS for layout, colors, typography
   - Consistent styling across components
   
9. **Make it responsive**
   - Mobile-friendly design
   - Responsive navigation and layout

### Phase 3: Content Development
10. **Build Home page content**
    - Hero section
    - Introduction to the service
    - Main features overview
    
11. **Build Resources page content**
    - Determine what resources to include
    - Organize content logically
    - Add relevant information for parents
    
12. **Add any additional pages**
    - Based on identified needs during development

### Phase 4: Polish & Features
13. **Improve styling**
    - Make it look professional
    - Enhance user experience
    - Add visual polish
    
14. **Add interactive features**
    - Forms, search, filters if needed
    - Enhanced functionality based on requirements
    
15. **Test everything thoroughly**
    - Cross-browser testing
    - Mobile testing
    - User experience testing
    
16. **Deploy** (optional but rewarding!)
    - Choose deployment platform
    - Set up build process
    - Make it live

## Why This Order Works
- **See progress immediately** - working navigation from day 1
- **Catch routing issues early** - before complex content is added
- **Build confidence** - each phase gives tangible results
- **Industry standard** - foundation → structure → content → polish

## Current Status
- [ ] Phase 1: Foundation
- [ ] Phase 2: Structure & Layout  
- [ ] Phase 3: Content Development
- [ ] Phase 4: Polish & Features

## Notes
- Start with Phase 1 - router installation is the first step
- Each phase builds upon the previous one
- Test thoroughly at each phase before moving forward
- Adjust plan as needed based on project requirements


# Research

## BigFuture by College Board

- Excellent mobile responsiveness

## Naviance (by Hobsons)
- Professional dashboard layout
- Clean data visualization for college planning
- Good use of cards/sections to organize information
- Trustworthy, institutional feel

## Common Application
- Simple, focused design

- Minimal but effective navigation
- Good information hierarchy

# FAQ Page Forum Feature Implementation Plan

## Goal
Allow users to create posts and see a feed of them on the home page, edit, delete, or leave comments underneath them for discussions, and give upvotes for posts that you like.

## Phase 1: Data Structure Planning
**First, decide how to store posts:**
- Each post needs: `id`, `title`, `content`, `author`, `timestamp`, `upvotes`, `comments[]`
- Start with local state (`useState`) for prototyping
- Later move to database (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.)

## Phase 2: Basic Post Creation & Display
**Start with the simplest version:**
1. **Create a Post component** - displays a single post
2. **Modify your FAQ form** - capture and store new posts in state
3. **Add a PostList component** - maps through posts and renders them
4. **Test with dummy data first** - create sample posts to see the layout

## Phase 3: State Management
**Choose your approach:**
- **React Context** - for sharing posts between FAQ and Home pages
- **Props drilling** - simpler but less scalable
- **State management library** - Redux, Zustand (for larger apps)

## Phase 4: Core Features (one at a time)
**Build these incrementally:**
1. **Upvoting system** - add counter, click handler
2. **Comments section** - nested form under each post
3. **Edit/Delete** - add buttons, edit mode toggle
4. **User identification** - simple username system first

## Phase 5: UI/UX Improvements
- **Sorting** (by date, upvotes, etc.)
- **Search/filtering**
- **Responsive design**
- **Loading states**

## Recommended Starting Point:
1. Create a simple `Post.jsx` component
2. Add a `posts` state array to your FAQ component
3. When form submits, add new post to the array
4. Display the posts below the form
5. Test this basic flow before adding complexity

## Key Questions to Answer First:
- Where will posts be displayed? (FAQ page, Home page, or both?)
- Do you need user authentication or just anonymous posts?
- Should posts persist between browser sessions?
