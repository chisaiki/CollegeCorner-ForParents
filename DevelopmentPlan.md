# CollegeCorner-ForParents Development Plan

## Project Overview
A React application designed to help parents navigate the college process for their children.

## Implementation Order

### Phase 1: Foundation (Get it working)
1. **Install react-router-dom**
   - Command: `npm install react-router-dom`
   
2. **Set up basic routing in App.jsx**
   - Configure routes for Home and Resources pages
   - Import and set up BrowserRouter, Routes, Route
   
3. **Create skeleton components**
   - Home.jsx with basic "Hello World" content
   - Resources.jsx with basic "Hello World" content
   
4. **Add basic navigation**
   - Simple buttons/links to test routing functionality
   
5. **Test navigation**
   - Verify clicking between pages works correctly

### Phase 2: Structure & Layout
6. **Design basic layout**
   - Header, navigation bar, footer in App.jsx
   - Define overall page structure
   - Card-based content for different sections
   - Clean sidebar navigation for easy access
   - Dashboard-style homepage with key info at a glance
   
   #### Topography
   - Large, readable fonts (parents often 40+ years old)
   - Clear headings to organize information
   - Good contrast for accessibility
   
7. **Add proper navigation menu**
   - Styled navigation with proper links
   - Use Link components from react-router-dom
   
8. **Set up basic styling**
   - CSS for layout, colors, typography
   - Consistent styling across components
   
9. **Make it responsive**
   - Mobile-friendly design
   - Responsive navigation and layout

### Phase 3: Content Development
10. **Build Home page content**
    - Hero section
    - Introduction to the service
    - Main features overview
    
11. **Build Resources page content**
    - Determine what resources to include
    - Organize content logically
    - Add relevant information for parents
    
12. **Add any additional pages**
    - Based on identified needs during development

### Phase 4: Polish & Features
13. **Improve styling**
    - Make it look professional
    - Enhance user experience
    - Add visual polish
    
14. **Add interactive features**
    - Forms, search, filters if needed
    - Enhanced functionality based on requirements
    
15. **Test everything thoroughly**
    - Cross-browser testing
    - Mobile testing
    - User experience testing
    
16. **Deploy** (optional but rewarding!)
    - Choose deployment platform
    - Set up build process
    - Make it live

## Why This Order Works
- **See progress immediately** - working navigation from day 1
- **Catch routing issues early** - before complex content is added
- **Build confidence** - each phase gives tangible results
- **Industry standard** - foundation → structure → content → polish

## Current Status
- [ ] Phase 1: Foundation
- [ ] Phase 2: Structure & Layout  
- [ ] Phase 3: Content Development
- [ ] Phase 4: Polish & Features

## Notes
- Start with Phase 1 - router installation is the first step
- Each phase builds upon the previous one
- Test thoroughly at each phase before moving forward
- Adjust plan as needed based on project requirements
